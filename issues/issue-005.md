# Unity Dev Weekly
## Issue 4

*August 5th 2016*​

After upgrading a fairly large project to Unity 5.4 this week, I can say it has been the smoothest version transition in recent memory. Hats off to the Unity team for improving both the quality and stability of this release compared to past releases. The extended beta cycle and the focus on test coverage and automation really seems to be paying off.

#### [A LOOK INSIDE: UNITY RELEASE MANAGEMENT SERIES](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/08/01/a-look-inside-unity-release-management-series/)
​
A detailed look at Unity's changing practices when it comes to releasing new versions.
​
tl;dr Unity's has been improving quality by focusing on:
* Build system improvements.
* Test Automation.
* Focusing on 5.4 before moving on to 5.5.
* QA involved more during development.
* Early public beta testing.
* More QA and improved test coverage.
* Having higher standards in their practices.
​
Really great to see all of this.

#### [Unity on Linux: Release Notes and Known Issues](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-on-linux-release-notes-and-known-issues.350256/)
​
Very cool to see Linux still getting love from the team inside Unity, with this a 5.4 final release available as pretty much the same time as the Windows and macOS versions.
​
Scroll to the last post in the thread to get the latest build.
​
With the imminent advent of Vulkan, I wouldn't be surprised to see Linux as a serious platform for game development in the not too distant future.

### Game Development
​
#### [Designing Better Levels Through Human Survival Instincts](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/6411/designing_better_levels_through_.php)
​
Timeless five page article from 2011 on level design leveraging the same principles that real-world architects use when designing buildings. From the claustraphobic corridors of Resident Evil, to the wide open vulnerable 'prospect' space of a boss fight, this piece lays a framework to create compelling environments for your game or simulation.

Some power user features of Visual Studio covered here. Moving code about with Alt+Up/Down, and making Intellisense popups transparent by holding Ctrl were both revelations to me. Lots of great tips here.
