### Code

#### [Custom Coroutines](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/12/01/custom-coroutines/)

Article from December last year on the Unity blog about creating your own `IEnumerable` type, which can be useful to do custom things when using coroutines. In this case, waiting for a specified time, regardless of the current scaled time value.

### Tools

#### [Visual Studio+ReSharper-level Productivity in VSCode](https://blog.uship.com/shippingcode/visual-studioresharper-level-productivity-in-vscode/)

Nice article from the uShip blog about how to setup VSCode to be nearly as good as Visual Studio + ReSharper. Ideal if you use macOS or Linux for your development work. MonoDevelop just doesn't cut it on the other platforms in comparison.

A unified editor window that allows you to use many editor scripts submitted by the Unity community. Nice way of keeping these useful things all in one place.

#### [Making Sense of Hard Edges](http://polycount.com/discussion/107196/youre-making-me-hard-making-sense-of-hard-edges-uvs-normal-maps-and-vertex-counts)

Informative article on how to effectively achieve that faceted, hard-edge look in your models. It's not as simple as it seems at first glace. The post covers UVs, normal maps and vertex counts - they all play a part in achieving the flat-shaded style.
