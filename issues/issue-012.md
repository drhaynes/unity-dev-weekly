# Unity Dev Weekly
## Issue 12
23 September 2016

### News

A fairly quiet week for Unity this week. No doubt we'll see some exciting stuff coming in this month's upcoming VR themed events.

A brief schedule:

* 4th October: Google Daydream development announcement.
* 5th-7th October: Oculus Connect conference.
* 12th - 13th October: Steam Dev Days

Some or all of these events will have some Unity related announcements, so watch this space for the usual tl;dr summary.

I'm away on holiday for the next fortnight, so the next issue will be out on the 14th of October.

#### [Closed Source Engines are a Big Risk](http://stephaniehurlburt.com/blog/2016/9/16/closed-source-engines-are-a-big-risk)

Very insightful article from Stephanie Hurlburt (ex. Oculus and Unity) discussing how Unity being a black box can be a liability for your project as you push up against the fringes of what is possible outside of fairly standard usage. Anyone who has tried to hack the internal rendering in a Unity project (e.g. to tweak the shadow system, for example), or has written any native code plugins that need to play nice with Unity's rendering subsystem will recognise this.
